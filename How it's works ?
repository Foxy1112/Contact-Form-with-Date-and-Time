It's a custom made Contact Form and can be used in WordPress sites. In my case i am using it trough Divi Builder.

Steps do make it work trough Divi:

Create a Code module and put HTML, CSS and Java snippets to in one place. Then move send_email.php file to a Child Theme and path should be - '/wp-content/themes/Divi-Child-Theme/send_email.php'

Trough send_email.php can be changed email adress where you can recieve those contact forms.
